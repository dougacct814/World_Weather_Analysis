# World_Weather_Analysis

## Challenge Overview

Jack loves the app. Beta testers love the app. And, with any new product, there are some changes that could take it from a nice app to an awesome app. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement the feedback from the beta testers, which is listed below.

1. A weather description to the pop-up markers for customers so that they know what the weather is as they are traveling
2. A notation in the search criteria to indicate if it is raining or snowing for customers who are making travel decisions in real-time
3. A map that shows the directions for customersâ€™ travel itinerary

The goals for this challenge are for you to:

1. Use nested try-except blocks.
2. Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
3. Create a new DataFrame from a new API search with new weather parameters.
4. Filter DataFrames based on input and nested decision statements, and logical expressions.
5. Create pop-up markers on a Google map from a filtered DataFrame.
6. Add a directions layer on a Google map between cities in the filtered DataFrame.
